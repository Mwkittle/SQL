# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#Which artists have more than 1 top 50 song, and how many?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) as Num50 FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING Num50>1
ORDER BY Num50 desc;

#Determined the average popularity, danceability, and engery by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy) From Spotifydata
Group By artist_name, track_name;

#What were the top 10 loudest songs, and who sang them?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(loudness) From Spotifydata
Group By artist_name
Order by MAX(loudness) desc
Limit 10;
